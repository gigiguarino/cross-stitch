			We are creating a website that takes in an image and outputs a cross-stitch pattern
        	of that image. We are also going to ask the user the desired size of the cross-stitch, height and width, and the fabric count, stitches per inch, they are using.<br><br>
        	Currently this website is hosted through my other website, as a separate page, but I am going to buy a cheap domain name and change it to that before the due date.
