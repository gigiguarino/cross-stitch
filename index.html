    <h2>Downsampling</h2>
    <h3>What is downsampling?</h3>
    <p>
    	Downsampling creates a lower-rate sequence by keeping <br>
    	only one out of N samples in the original signal. <br>
    	It discards (N - 1) out of N samples and causes a loss of <br>
    	information in the original sequence. <br>
    	X[n] -> X[N*n] <br>
    	X[n] = x[-2] x[1] x[0] x[1] x[2]...<br>
    	Downsampled...<br>
    	Xd[n] = x[-4] x[-2] x[0] x[2] x[4]...<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What would direct downsampling do at different rates?</h3>
    <p>
    	You could get any size pixels-per-inch by downsampling and <br>
    	un-sampling back. 
    </p>
    <h2>Conversion</h2>
    <h3>How to convert an image of a certain pixel count?</h3>
    <p>
    	An image is sized pixels by pixels. <br>
    	A cross stitch is sized inches by inches. <br>
    	An important value is the amount of stitches/inch the <br>
    	cross-stitching fabric has. This is called fabric count. <br>
    	You would downsample each row and column by a value N. <br>
    	This N = (Pixels)/(Inches*Count) <br>
    	Inches = the length of the height/width of the column/row. <br>
    	Pixels = the amount of pixels in the column/row of the image. <br>
    	Count = fabric count, or stitches/inch. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Common Fabric Counts</h3>
    <p>
    	11, 14, 18, 28
    </p>
    <h2>Edge Detection</h2>
    <p>
    	Matlab has built-in functions that detect edges in images. <br>
    	There are two different types. <br>
    	The first type is called "Sobel." This type creates a new <br>
    	image with only general outlines of shapes in it. I think this <br>
    	type would be more relevant for our project since only the most <br>
    	important shapes need to be outlined. <br>
    	The second type is called "Canny." This type creates a new image <br>
    	with basically every outline in it. This one creates an edge for any <br>discontinuity in the picture. I don't think this one would be good for <br>
    	our project because if we were to have edge around every single <br>
    	discontinuity, our cross-stitch would have too many outlines. The <br>
    	actual cross-stitch would be lost. 
    </p>
    <h3>Matlab Code</h3>
    <p>
    	image = imread('');
    	edge(image, 'type');
    </p>

    <h2>Reviews of Sites</h2>
    <h3>First Site (pic2pat)</h3>
    <p>
    	I really liked this site. I thought it was cool how it gave you a couple <br>
    	options at the end, so you can choose the one you prefer. <br>
    	I'm not sure yet if I want to give the output in color blocks or in symbols. <br>
    	This website gave the output in colored blocks, and it looked nice, but doesn't <br>
    	look exactly like a cross-stitch pattern looks. <br>
    	This website is pretty poorly designed also. <br>
    	I'm thinking I will take how they handled their input, with the length/width and <br>
    	stitches/inch. I don't want to output many cross-stich patterns at the end, only <br>
    	one good one.
    </p>
    <h3>Second Site (myphotostitch)</h3>
    <p>
    	I liked this site less. This website only worked well for big pictures. The <br>
    	pictures come out really tiny if you don't. It was nice how they gave you the <br>
    	option to print out in either symbols or in colored boxes. <br>
    	I also thought this website was poorly designed. <br>
